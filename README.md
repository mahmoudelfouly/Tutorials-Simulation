Note
----
Thank you for the opportunity to work on this task. I appreciate the chance to challenge myself and explore new concepts, especially under a tight schedule due to my full-time job.

While you might find the task incomplete, I want to share that it presented both easy and challenging aspects. The composables came together relatively smoothly, but highlighting and implementing the tutorial elements proved more difficult, as this was my first experience with these features. Additionally, the limited time I had to devote to this task was a factor.

From a technical standpoint, I decided not to introduce use cases for simpler methods, as they were not necessary for the task at hand. Instead of creating separate modules for each layer, I opted for organizing them into packages, which allowed me to focus more on other aspects of the task.

I believe that this exercise is less about completing every detail and more about understanding what we can achieve within the given timeframe. My primary focus was on capturing the core ideas, specifically how to highlight and position the tooltip, while striving to align with the Figma design.

Thank you once again for this opportunity. It has been a valuable learning experience for me.
